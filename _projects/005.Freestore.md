### Overview
This project is a work in progress. Presently, the UX/UI architecture has been worked out, and a couple prototypes have been built, however it is not at the stage of production yet.

### Concept
FreeStore(working title) is a web-based application that allows users to create ledger entries based on earnings from their freelance gigs. The user can store data about each project and export invoices.

#### Problem
This Service solves the following pain: scrambling for earnings reports come tax time.

#### Solution
Provide an application that allows users to track earnings, so when it comes tax time, itâ€™s as simple as exporting data.
