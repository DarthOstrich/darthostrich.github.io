### Concept  
The Idea for this app came out of being [crippled by choice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Paradox_of_Choice), when it came to choosing a place to eat. The basic idea was to return results from a Yelp query and then choose only one of those choices, thus letting the computer choose where to eat.

### Architecture

React Native is capable of taking code written in JavaScript (albeit, a very specific version of JS), and transpiling it into Native code (Swift and Java). As mentioned before, I used the Yelp API to fetch results and some simple logic to decide which option to choose and display it in the app. If you'd like a more in depth discussion, see my post [here](https://medium.com).
