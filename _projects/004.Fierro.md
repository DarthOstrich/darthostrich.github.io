# Front End

### Overview
The front end of the website is built with PhP and pulls info from a MySQL database. The content is managed by a back-end system that is described below.

### Layout
The homepage displays the latest blog posts and gallery images.

# Back End

### Overview
The back end system is a custom Content Management System that I built in PhP. It offers the ability to upload images and create blog posts, which are saved in a MySQL database on my server.

### Layout
The admin home page gives a list of the latest blog posts, as well as a quick way to manage access privileges for users.
