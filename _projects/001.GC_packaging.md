Texas based card producers GC Packaging wanted to update their old website to more modern look. In this project, I was hired to develop their website from scratch. I started with wireframes and mockups, which went through several rounds. Once GC Packaging signed off, I hand-coded the website and made small adjustments to the layout as the project went forward.


### Style guide

Two style guides were authored, however they chose this style.

### h3 Wireframes

The wireframes went through a number of changes, this wireframe was one of the earlier versions.
