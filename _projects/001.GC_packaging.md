description: Texas based card producers GC Packaging wanted to update their old website to a more modern look. In this project, I was hired to develop their website from scratch. I started with wireframes and mockups, which went through several rounds. Once GC Packaging signed off, I hand-coded the website and made small adjustments to the layout as the project went forward.
